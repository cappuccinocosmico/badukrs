## Step 1 Breakdown: Interactive Go Game Board

**Main Goal:** Create a web-based Go board that allows two players to take turns placing stones locally.

### Intermediate Steps:

1. **Create basic Bevy game board structure**
   - Set up Bevy app with basic window and camera
   - Create 19x19 grid visual representation
   - Add grid lines and coordinate markers
   - Implement board rendering with proper spacing

2. **Implement Go stone placement system**
   - Add mouse/touch input detection for board intersections
   - Create stone entities (black/white sprites or meshes)
   - Implement coordinate mapping from screen to board positions
   - Add visual feedback for valid placement locations

3. **Add turn-based player switching logic**
   - Create game state system to track current player
   - Implement turn alternation (black starts, then white)
   - Add visual indicators for whose turn it is
   - Prevent moves when it's not a player's turn

4. **Implement basic Go game rules validation**
   - Check for occupied intersections (prevent illegal placements)
   - Implement capture logic (remove surrounded stones)
   - Add basic ko rule prevention (no immediate recapture)
   - Handle pass moves and game end detection

5. **Set up WASM build configuration for browser deployment**
   - Configure Cargo.toml for web target
   - Set up trunk or wasm-pack build pipeline
   - Add necessary web-specific Bevy features
   - Create HTML template with canvas element

6. **Create offline-capable web interface**
   - Ensure all game logic runs client-side
   - Package all assets for offline use
   - Test functionality without server connection
   - Add service worker for complete offline capability

7. **Test local two-player gameplay functionality**
   - Verify stone placement works correctly
   - Test turn switching and visual feedback
   - Validate capture mechanics work properly
   - Ensure game can be played from start to finish

Each step builds on the previous one, creating a fully functional local Go game that works offline in the browser.
